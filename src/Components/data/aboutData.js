        text: `The interior of the DyNasty Bookstores is a cutting-edge project and a moving metaphor at once. It 
        has been designed by Warsaw architect Kacper Gronkiewicz. Wooden walls with cut abstract patterns 
        were composed into an interior full of platforms, shelves and stairs caught in a net of geometric 
        divisions. Seen from a distance, it builds into a contour of a University building which used to stand where 
        the Blue Skyscraper stands today.`,
